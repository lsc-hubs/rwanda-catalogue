# Rwanda Land Soil Crop catalogue
A catalogue for LSC datasets, services and applications from Rwanda. The content of this catalogue is published at intervals at https://rwanda.lsc-hubs.org.

## Work in progress
The metadata records are currently hosted in a [git repository at Wageningen University](https://git.wur.nl). These records will be moved to this repostitory over the summer of 2023.

## Metadata control file
Records on this repository are stored in the [metadata control file](https://geopython.github.io/pygeometa/reference/mcf/) format (MCF). MCF is a subset of [ISO19139:2007](https://www.iso.org/standard/32557.html), encoded in [YAML](https://www.yaml.io/spec/). An online editor for MCF metadata is available at [https://osgeo.github.io/mdme/](https://osgeo.github.io/mdme/).

## LSC Hubs
The objective of this project is to develop sustainable land, soil, crop information hubs in national agricultural research organizations in East Africa to enhance the effectiveness of national Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) and contribute to rural transformation and climate-smart agriculture.
